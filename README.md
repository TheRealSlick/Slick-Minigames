# Slick-Minigames
Minigame project for class

IMPORTANT!!

Unfortunately, no score counter D:

For the Simon Says Game, I wasn't able to get the actual "game logic" functional. I.E: Starting, pausing, ending game. Pausing the game breaks it, so just refresh the page

For the BlackJack game, there is this bug where it'll deal 4 cards for each player, you and the dealer. Why? Beats me! Refresh it and it shouldn't happen again. 


HTML and CSS: Me
JS: Me

BlackJack: BlackJack is a simple card game, get 21 or beat the dealer! Dealer must stand on 17, don't go over 21, if you stand on something lower than 21, and the dealer has a higher number than that, then you lose! Good luck!
Simon Says: Based off https://kuku-kube.com. It is a color test that tests your eyes on how well you can differentiate a color amoung many.
Word Games: I didn't even get to scratch the surface of those, so I deleted them from the final project. Nothing to show for that.

Root Folder: This was supposed to be a hub for the games. A dedicated page to navigate the pages to. Did not complete the full vision, but the concept is there.


Hope you enjoy!
